# Software Rasterizer

A simple software rasterizer written in Rust.

## Overview

This project implements a basic software rasterizer from scratch, focusing on learning and demonstrating the fundamentals of 3D graphics rendering without relying on GPU acceleration. It is intended as an educational tool and a foundation for further graphics programming experiments.

## Features

- Triangle rasterization
- Basic vertex and fragment processing
- Color interpolation
- Simple framebuffer output

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (edition 2021 or later)

### Build and Run

```sh
```
```
cargo run
```

This will compile and execute the rasterizer. Output will be written to the framebuffer or as an image file, depending on implementation.
